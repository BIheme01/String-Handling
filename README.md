# String-Handling

## Task

Follow these steps:
1. Create a file called alternative.py
2. Write a program that reads in a string and makes each alternate character into an upper case character and each other alternate character lower case character.
e.g. The string “Hello World” would become “HeLlO WoRlD”
3. Now, try starting with the same string but making each alternative word
lower and upper case.
e.g. The string: “I am learning to code” would become “i AM learning
TO code”.
#### Tip: Using the split() and join() functions will help you here.
